        <h2>Hello baby >.<</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been thinking about how to say this without overcomplicating things, but maybe the best way is just to be honest.
From the moment we started talking, I knew you were different. You’re smart, fun, and beautiful in a way that’s impossible to ignore, but what truly amazes me is your heart. You see people for who they are, without judgment, and that’s something rare. It’s something I admire deeply about you.
I don’t want to just be someone who admires you from a distance. I want to court you. Not just with words, but with effort, patience, and sincerity. I want to know you, not just the easy parts, but the real you. Your dreams, your thoughts, even the things that make you overthink at night. I want to be someone you can rely on, someone who adds joy to your life, not just through promises but through actions.
I don’t expect an answer right away, and I won’t rush anything. I just want you to know that I’m serious about you. If you’ll allow me, I’d love the chance to prove that.
Whatever your response, I’ll always be grateful that I met you.

        </p>
        <div class="heart">❤️</div>
        <button onclick="alert('Iloveyousomuch loveee!^^')">PRESS ME BABY</button>
